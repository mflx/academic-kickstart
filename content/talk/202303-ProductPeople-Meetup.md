Product Management means different things in different contexts. Still, we talk about it like it's always the same thing. I offer a simple map based on the product lifecycle which helps to understand the phase of your product, your organization and the typical activities and metrics for that phase.

## Summary of the talk ##

_Educational summary of [Product Management in Different Stages of a Product by Martin Stahl, CPO at Curalie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpPEyjROE10) by [Video Summarizer](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-GvcYCKPIH-video-summarizer-ai)_

Martin Stahl, the Chief Product Officer at Curalie, discusses the nuances of product management across different stages of a product's lifecycle. This in-depth exploration provides valuable insights into how product management strategies and focuses shift as a product evolves from conception to maturity. Here are the highlights from his presentation:

- **Explore Phase:** In the initial stage, the focus is on identifying the market, understanding customer needs, and testing hypotheses. Product managers should embrace uncertainty and utilize generalist skills to explore various opportunities and challenges. Key activities include customer interviews, prototype testing, and market analysis.

- **Scale Phase:** Once a product-market fit is established, the emphasis shifts to scaling the product and the organization. This phase involves detailed planning, hiring more specialized roles, and expanding the product's features and market reach. Product managers in this phase work closely with development teams and stakeholders to prioritize features and manage the growing complexity of the product ecosystem.

- **Optimize Phase:** In the mature stage, the focus is on optimizing the product for efficiency and profitability. This includes fine-tuning features, improving user experience, and maximizing the product's value to customers. Product managers in this phase often deal with more detailed and specific challenges, requiring a deep understanding of the product and its market.

- **Metrics and Measures:** Different metrics are crucial at each phase, with early stages focusing on customer engagement and feedback, mid-stages on growth and scaling metrics, and later stages on profitability and efficiency measures.

- **Organizational Impact:** The product's lifecycle stage not only affects product management practices but also has significant implications for the organization's structure, processes, and culture. As products evolve, organizations need to adapt to support the changing needs of the product and the market.

This presentation underscores the importance of flexibility, strategic thinking, and customer-centricity in product management. It highlights the need for product managers to adapt their strategies and focus based on the product's lifecycle stage, ensuring that their efforts align with the current challenges and opportunities the product faces.

### Insights based on numbers

- A structured approach to product discovery is essential, regardless of the product lifecycle stage. Regular customer interviews, A/B testing, and metrics analysis can provide valuable insights and guide product development.

- As a product moves from the explore phase to the scale and optimize phases, the organizational structure and team dynamics evolve. The number of product managers, the specialization of roles, and the complexity of the product and market strategies increase.
