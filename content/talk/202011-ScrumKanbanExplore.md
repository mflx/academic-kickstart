A case study in pragmatic agilism: As a external product development team we should build a green field b2b product for car dealership. None of our team of software engineers, UX researcher and product had much knowledge about the business domain or the user. 

To explore this uncertainy and build a successful digital product we decided to optimize for one kanban metric: lead time. We wanted to be able not only to ship something every few days, but also have quick feedback cycles in user research. This talk is an example how to combine Kanban metrics, UX and Scrum and build a lightweigth process which is customized for a certain use case.
