Product Management means very different things in different contexts. Other peoples "Best practices" might not work on your desk. For many situations there's no "one-size fits all". How can you find out about the context you are in and what does it mean for your daily work and your career as PM.
In this talk we look into Product and Organization lifecycles, business models and business types, and Wardley's Pioneers Settlers and Town Planners.
