This year we are looking into the framework "The Responsibility Process" by Chris Avery. In situations when something goes wrong (like when a project was not finished or an email not answered), The Responsibility Process kicks in. Being aware of the phases of TRP and how we mentally process these situations, can keep us in freedom to chose and response-ability.

Session (60min) with discussion and exercises.
