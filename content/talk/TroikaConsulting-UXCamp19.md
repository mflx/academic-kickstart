Our workshop for this year's UXCamp Europe deals with the topic of how to work on and solve problems and challenges directly with colleagues in a quick and lean format.
The focus is not only on the benefit of the knowledge available in the company, but also on the change of perspective - a central point in systemic work.

Format: [Troika Consulting](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/8-troika-consulting%20/) from the [Liberation Structures](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/). 

Facilitation: [Heike RÃ¶ttgers](https://twitter.com/hemba), Martin
