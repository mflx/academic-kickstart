From my product trainings and coachings I know there's a lot of uncertainty around the Product Owner role. It originates in the Scrum framework and is defined in the [Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html). Many companies have adapted the role but often without creating the prerequisites necessary for a meaningful practice of product ownership..
This article collects a few characteristics that I consider important for a comprehensive exercise of the Product Owner role.

But first: what's the value in answering this question? 
Well, I personally think that the Product Owner role is the perfect tool for creating successful digital products. And many companies struggle with that, no matter if corporations, SMBs or startups. 

Here's a quick checklist with things I find crucial for the Product Owner role to be successfull. 

- [x] I know what my product is and can describe it anytime.
- [x] I know (or crafted) the product vision and I'm communicating it actively.
- [x] I know the value proposition of the product.
- [x] I follow a product strategy, aligned with the vision, to maximize the value of the product - for the users and the business.
- [x] I know my users (and customers) and I'm receiving regular feedback from them.
- [x] I know the impact of the product on the user.
- [x] I understand my organization's goals and how the product is contributing to them.
- [x] I have a holistic view on the organizational system surrounding the value chain of the product.
- [x] I spend as much time as possible together / co-located with my product development team.
- [x] My decisions are respected within the organization.

There is a lot more in the life of product people and many books and blog articles have been writing about this:

- Building a great product is a team sport and should be therefore owned and facilitated by the whole product development team (incl. all roles like UX, Dev, Coach etc).
- Leadership skills and an entrepreneurial mindset.
- Feedback cycles on various levels: outcome, user, team, upstream and delivery processes, organization / portfolio strategy. Scrum has created four events for inspection and adaption: Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Revew and Sprint Retrospective. In Kanban you have cadences for that purpose.
- Strong in analytics and crunching data. Therefore some of us love Excel even more than sticky notes or Dilbert. Personally I prefer Python with Pandas because the Excel UI is not my friend.
- Empathy with the user, stakeholders and leadership team.

Nevertheless, to distinguish an agile cargo-cult setup from an agile team, the above list should be a good-enough litmus test: Product people hired as Product Owners that find themselves in a role of feature manager, project manager, requirements engineer, Jira administrator or delivery facilitator (disclaimer: there might be value in these roles depending on the product), usually won't make it beyond 3. or 4. in the list above.

I hope it can be useful for anyone to understand the meaning of this role in their organization or to evaluate the culture of the company during a job interview.
