Many people in organizations, esp. in fast-paced tech and product companies are usually somewhat curious about every new technology on the market. And they are always looking for ways to simplify their hectic day-to-day work. Annoying routine tasks in particular can be automated and make the life of many of us easier.

Here is an (incomplete) overview of tools and little helpers that are based on or use AI technologies.

Short reminder: for many documents and other artefacts (like roadmaps PRDs etc)it is not the finished document that makes it effective, but **the communication and alignment** about and around it. The tool cannot replace this social level of an artifact. Nevertheless, it may be a good way to fill a blank sheet or to start the conversation.
