## About me ##

Coaching and consulting Organizations and Teams in dynamic phases like scaling, change or innovation to a better, sustainable and healthy delivery. Deep understanding of digital products and business models. Holistic and hypothesis-based Product Management by looking at the right metrics. Supporting teams, individuals and business units on their way to an agile mindset and work practices like Scrum and Kanban with a systemic and solution-focussed approach.

I work and lead based on the **values** focus, collaboration, transparency, respect and courage. 
**Leadship** means enabling spaces where motivated individuals and teams can collaborate, driven by a vision and creating value.

**Community** work like barcamps, learning circles, community of practices and supervision are an integral part of my professional life.
